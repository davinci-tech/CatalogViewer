# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

# Intro

Finally, a decent app for my grades (today is 22 May, on the 10th of June I finish school - so it's a little late... but still it's cool).

## Features

- **Fetch Grades & Absences:** Retrieves grades and absences from the school's API.
- **Subject Summaries:** Displays a summary card for each subject, showing average score, all grades, and unmotivated absences.
- **Responsive Design:** Uses a drawer on mobile and a side sheet on desktop for detailed subject views.
- **Modern UI:** Styled with Tailwind CSS, Radix UI components, and the Roboto font.
- **Theme Support:** Light/dark mode toggle.
- **Page Refresh:** Manual refresh control for up-to-date data.
